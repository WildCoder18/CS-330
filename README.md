CS 330 3D Scene Project
Overview

I created a workspace setup where each object is built from simple 3D shapes—like the microphone using a cylinder and a sphere, the laptop made of boxes, and the mouse as a smooth, tapered shape. I applied textures to the laptop and table to make them feel more realistic and set up two light sources, including a colored point light near the microphone, to give the scene depth. Users can navigate around the scene using WASD and QE keys for movement, the mouse for pitch and yaw, and even adjust camera speed with the scroll wheel.

Learning & Skills

This was my first time working with OpenGL and Object3D, so it was definitely one of the most challenging projects I’ve tackled. I learned how all the different pieces—modeling, textures, lighting, and camera controls—need to work together to make the scene feel alive. I also realized that small tweaks to light placement or camera angles can completely change how a scene looks, which taught me to be patient and methodical when iterating.

Reflections & Future Goals

I still have questions about computational graphics, such as optimizing rendering for more complex scenes and creating realistic physics interactions between objects. I’d also like to explore advanced shaders and real-time lighting in future projects. These skills will be very useful as I continue in programming and software development. Learning how to build interactive 3D environments gives me a foundation for game development, simulations, or visualization tools. Overall, I feel more confident tackling projects that require combining multiple technical components into one cohesive program.
